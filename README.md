`kody` is an experimental personal assistant platform built on Cloudflare
Workers and the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It ships a Remix UI, Worker-based
request routing, package runtime plumbing, and OAuth-protected MCP endpoints.
The project favors a compact MCP surface with powerful `search` and Code Mode
`execute` flows over a large static tool catalog.

Kody is a multi-user personal assistant: each signed-in user gets a fully
isolated assistant (packages, jobs, secrets, values, memories, and related
state). Tests and fixtures may seed deterministic local accounts, but no account
is privileged at runtime. The repo follows several
[epicflare](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/epicflare) starter conventions.

The repo is organized as an Nx monorepo, with shared modules in
`packages/shared` (`@kody-internal/shared`), the main app worker under
`packages/worker`, and mock Workers under `packages/mock-servers/*`.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs at `localhost:8787`. Wrangler handles the local Cloudflare
Workers runtime and D1 database automatically.

To scaffold a **new** project from the epicflare template instead, run
`npx create-epicflare`.

## Scope

- Personal assistant experiment, not a multi-tenant SaaS product
- MCP-first architecture intended to work across compatible AI agent hosts
- Compact MCP surface area preferred over a large static tool inventory
- ChatGPT is a likely primary host target, while keeping the server usable from
  other MCP hosts where practical

## How It Works

```
Request → packages/worker/src/index.ts
              │
              ├─→ OAuth handlers
              ├─→ MCP endpoints
              ├─→ Static assets (`packages/worker/public/`)
              └─→ Server router → Remix components
```

- `packages/worker/src/index.ts` is the entrypoint for Cloudflare Workers
- OAuth requests are handled first, then MCP requests, then static assets
- Non-asset requests fall through to the server handler and router
- Client assets are bundled into `packages/worker/public/` and served via the
  `ASSETS` binding
